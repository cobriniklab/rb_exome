	abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary history and subclonal composition of a tumour represents one of the key challenges in overcoming treatment failure due to resistant cell populations. Most of the current data on tumour genetics stems from short read bulk sequencing data. While this type of data is characterised by low sequencing noise and cost, it consists of aggregate measurements across a large number of cells. It is therefore of limited use for the accurate detection of the distinct cellular populations present in a tumour and the unambiguous inference of their evolutionary relationships. Single-cell DNA sequencing instead provides data of the highest resolution for studying intra-tumour heterogeneity and evolution, but is characterised by higher sequencing costs and elevated noise rates. In this work, we develop the ﬁrst computational approach that infers trees of tumour evolution from combined single-cell and bulk sequencing data. Using a comprehensive set of simulated data, we show that our approach systematically outperforms existing methods with respect to tree reconstruction accuracy and subclone identiﬁcation. High ﬁdelity reconstructions are obtained even with a modest number of single cells. We also show that combining single-cell and bulk sequencing data provides more realistic mutation histories for real tumours.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.
RESULTS: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both.

However, the extensive cellular heterogeneity of the developing CNS has posed a major obstacle to identifying the gene regulatory networks that control these processes. To address this, we used single cell RNA-sequencing to profile ten developmental stages encompassing the full course of retinal neurogenesis. This allowed us to comprehensively characterize changes in gene expression that occur during initiation of neurogenesis, changes in developmental competence, and specification and differentiation of each of the major retinal cell types. These data identify transitions in gene expression between early and late-stage retinal progenitors, as well as a classification of neurogenic progenitors. We identify here the NFI family of transcription factors (Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix) as genes with enriched expression within late RPCs, and show they are regulators of bipolar interneuron and Muller glia specification and the control of proliferative quiescence.},

Here, we show that retinoblastoma cells express markers of postmitotic cone precursors but not markers of other retinal cell types. We also demonstrate that human cone precursors prominently express MDM2 and N-Myc, that retinoblastoma cells require both of these proteins for proliferation and survival, and that MDM2 is needed to suppress ARF-induced apoptosis in cultured retinoblastoma cells. Interestingly, retinoblastoma cell MDM2 expression was regulated by the cone-specific RXRγ transcription factor and a human-specific RXRγ consensus binding site, and proliferation required RXRγ, as well as the cone-specific thyroid hormone receptor-β2. These findings provide support for a cone precursor origin of retinoblastoma and suggest that human cone-specific signaling circuitry sensitizes to the oncogenic effects of RB1 mutations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Recurrent inactivating mutations have been identified in various hematological malignancies in the X-linked BCOR gene encoding BCL6 corepressor (BCOR); however, its tumor suppressor function remains largely uncharacterized. We generated mice missing Bcor exon 4, expressing a variant BCOR lacking the BCL6-binding domain. Although the deletion of exon 4 in male mice (Bcor(ΔE4/y) ) compromised the repopulating capacity of hematopoietic stem cells, Bcor(ΔE4/y) thymocytes had augmented proliferative capacity in culture and showed a strong propensity to induce acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), mostly in a Notch-dependent manner. Myc, one of the critical NOTCH1 targets in T-ALL, was highly up-regulated in Bcor(ΔE4/y) T-ALL cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation/DNA sequencing analysis revealed that BCOR was recruited to the Myc promoter and restrained its activation in thymocytes. BCOR also targeted other NOTCH1 targets and potentially antagonized their transcriptional activation. Bcl6-deficient thymocytes behaved in a manner similar to Bcor(ΔE4/y) thymocytes. Our results provide the first evidence of a tumor suppressor role for BCOR in the pathogenesis of T lymphocyte malignancies.},

	abstract = {Most retinoblastomas initiate in response to the inactivation of the RB1 gene and loss of functional RB protein. The tumors may form with few additional genomic changes and develop after a premalignant retinoma phase. Despite this seemingly straightforward etiology, mouse models have not recapitulated the genetic, cellular, and stage-specific features of human retinoblastoma genesis. For example, whereas human retinoblastomas appear to derive from cone photoreceptor precursors, current mouse models develop tumors that derive from other retinal cell types. To investigate the basis of the human cone-specific oncogenesis, we compared developmental stage-specific cone precursor responses to RB loss in human and murine retina cultures and in cone-specific Rb1-knockout mice. We report that RB-depleted maturing (ARR3+) but not immature (ARR3-) human cone precursors enter the cell cycle, proliferate, and form retinoblastoma-like lesions with Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, then form low or nonproliferative premalignant retinoma-like lesions with fleurettes and p16INK4A and p130 expression, and finally form highly proliferative retinoblastoma-like masses. In contrast, in murine retina, only RB-depleted immature (Arr3-) cone precursors entered the cell cycle, and they failed to progress from S to M phase. Moreover, whereas intrinsically highly expressed MDM2 and MYCN contribute to RB-depleted maturing (ARR3+) human cone precursor proliferation, ectopic MDM2 and Mycn promoted only immature (Arr3-) murine cone precursor cell-cycle entry. These findings demonstrate that developmental stage-specific as well as species- and cell type-specific features sensitize to RB1 inactivation and reveal the human cone precursors' capacity to model retinoblastoma initiation, proliferation, premalignant arrest, and tumor growth.},

	abstract = {The concept of absorptive capacity was introduced by Cohen and Levinthal in 1989. Since then it has been enhanced through reconceptualizations and extended by various empirical studies. Despite the growing interest in absorptive capacity it is unclear what this large stream of papers has collectively accomplished. The used definitions, antecedents, components and outcomes of the construct are extremely heterogeneous. Due to this heterogeneity, the empirical study of the construct remains difficult. There is no standard measure and no standard method of measurement, which can be used in empirical research. To bring more clarity into this research area, this paper provides a critical review of previous empirical treatments of absorptive capacity. For this purpose, different methods of measurement are classified in the following way: within quantitative methods proxy indicators and perceptive instruments are differentiated. Proxy indicators use single firm-level data for measuring absorptive capacity and can be input-oriented (R\&D efforts, R\&D human capital) or output-oriented (R\&D patents, R\&D publications). Perceptive instruments imply that researchers develop single questions or a set of questions, which reflect absorptive capacity or parts of it at the operational level. The main weakness of both proxy indicators and perceptive instruments is that they don't meet the complexity and emergence of the construct. Only few qualitative studies have started to adopt a new perspective, recognizing the process and practice-based character of absorptive capacity. In summary, the critical review prints out the necessity of advancing research in this area. For this reason, we set out to develop an alternative approach to capture absorptive capacity. It is a practice-oriented approach that allows studying actual absorptive practices in real world situations and enables researchers to capture the complex, embedded, and context-dependent patterns of acting.},

	abstract = {Polycomb group proteins regulate self-renewal and differentiation in many stem cell systems. When assembled into two canonical complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, they sequentially deposit H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub histone marks and establish repressive chromatin, referred to as Polycomb domains. Non-canonical PRC1 complexes retain RING1/RNF2 E3-ubiquitin ligases but have unique sets of accessory subunits. How these non-canonical complexes recognize and regulate their gene targets remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the BCL6 co-repressor (BCOR), a member of the PRC1.1 complex, is critical for maintaining primed pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). BCOR depletion leads to the erosion of Polycomb domains at key developmental loci and the initiation of differentiation along endoderm and mesoderm lineages. The C terminus of BCOR regulates the assembly and targeting of the PRC1.1 complex, while the N terminus contributes to BCOR-PRC1.1 repressor function. Our findings advance understanding of Polycomb targeting and repression in ESCs and could apply broadly across developmental systems. Molecular networks responsible for the maintenance of primed pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remain poorly defined. Wang et al. identify BCOR as a critical hESC regulator that defines a subtype of the PRC1.1 complexes with distinct recruitment and repression mechanisms that are essential for silencing differentiation programs in hESCs.},

	abstract = {Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of cancer are increasingly being used to assess putative driver mutations identified by large-scale sequencing of human cancer genomes. To accurately interpret experiments that introduce additional mutations, an understanding of the somatic genetic profile and evolution of GEMM tumors is necessary. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of tumors from three GEMMs of lung adenocarcinoma driven by mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras), or overexpression of MYC proto-oncogene. Tumors from EGFR- and Kras-driven models exhibited, respectively, 0.02 and 0.07 nonsynonymous mutations per megabase, a dramatically lower average mutational frequency than observed in human lung adenocarcinomas. Tumors from models driven by strong cancer drivers (mutant EGFR and Kras) harbored few mutations in known cancer genes, whereas tumors driven by MYC, a weaker initiating oncogene in the murine lung, acquired recurrent clonal oncogenic Kras mutations. In addition, although EGFR- and Kras-driven models both exhibited recurrent whole-chromosome DNA copy number alterations, the specific chromosomes altered by gain or loss were different in each model. These data demonstrate that GEMM tumors exhibit relatively simple somatic genotypes compared with human cancers of a similar type, making these autochthonous model systems useful for additive engineering approaches to assess the potential of novel mutations on tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and drug sensitivity.},

The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAVAILABILITY: The Strelka workflow source code is available at ftp://strelka@ftp.illumina.com/.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONTACT: csaunders@illumina.com},

	abstract = {Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

Numerous methods have been developed to identify driver genes, but evaluation of the performance of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard, i.e., bona fide driver gene mutations. Here, we establish an evaluation framework that can be applied when a gold standard is not available. We used this framework to compare the performance of eight driver gene prediction methods. One of these methods, newly described here, incorporated a machine learning-based ratiometric approach. We show that the driver genes predicted by each of these eight methods vary widely. Moreover, the p-values reported by several of the methods were inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into question the assumptions that were used to generate them. Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained variability in mutation rates on false positive driver gene predictions. Our analysis points to the strengths and weaknesses of each of the currently available methods and offers guidance for improving them in the future.},

We adapted methods from molecular evolution and applied them to 7,664 tumors across 29 cancer types. Unlike species evolution, positive selection outweighs negative selection during cancer development. On average, {\textless}1 coding base substitution/tumor is lost through negative selection, with purifying selection almost absent outside homozygous loss of essential genes. This allows exome-wide enumeration of all driver coding mutations, including outside known cancer genes. On average, tumors carry ∼4 coding substitutions under positive selection, ranging from {\textless}1/tumor in thyroid and testicular cancers to {\textgreater}10/tumor in endometrial and colorectal cancers. Half of driver substitutions occur in yet-to-be-discovered cancer genes. With increasing mutation burden, numbers of driver mutations increase, but not linearly. We systematically catalog cancer genes and show that genes vary extensively in what proportion of mutations are drivers versus passengers. Adapting an evolutionary genomics approach to cancer highlights a limited impact of negative selection on cancer genomes and significant variations in the proportion of coding driver mutations per tumor among different tumor types.},

	abstract = {Background: Single-cell micro-metastases of solid tumors often occur in the bone marrow. These disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) may resist therapy and lay dormant or progress to cause overt bone and visceral metastases. The molecular nature of DTCs remains elusive, as well as when and from where in the tumor they originate. Here, we apply single-cell sequencing to identify and trace the origin of DTCs in breast cancer.
Results: We sequence the genomes of 63 single cells isolated from six non-metastatic breast cancer patients. By comparing the cells’ DNA copy number aberration (CNA) landscapes with those of the primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, we establish that 53\% of the single cells morphologically classified as tumor cells are DTCs disseminating from the observed tumor. The remaining cells represent either non-aberrant “normal” cells or “aberrant cells of unknown origin” that have CNA landscapes discordant from the tumor. Further analyses suggest that the prevalence of aberrant cells of unknown origin is age-dependent and that at least a subset is hematopoietic in origin. Evolutionary reconstruction analysis of bulk tumor and DTC genomes enables ordering of CNA events in molecular pseudo-time and traced the origin of the DTCs to either the main tumor clone, primary tumor subclones, or subclones in an axillary lymph node metastasis.
Conclusions: Single-cell sequencing of bone marrow epithelial-like cells, in parallel with intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity profiling from bulk DNA, is a powerful approach to identify and study DTCs, yielding insight into metastatic processes. A heterogeneous population of CNA-positive cells is present in the bone marrow of non-metastatic breast cancer patients, only part of which are derived from the observed tumor lineages.},

Using CRTs to conduct quantitative assessments of adaptive responses to therapeutics, we uncovered a multitude of functionally heterogeneous subpopulations of cells with differential degrees of drug sensitivity. High-throughput isolation and deep characterization of unique clonal lineages showed genetic and transcriptomic diversity underlying functionally diverse subpopulations. Molecular annotation of gemcitabine-naive clonal lineages with distinct responses to treatment in the context of CRTs generated signatures that can predict the response to chemotherapy, representing a potential biomarker to stratify patients with pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer of the infant retina that is diagnosed in approximately 8,000 children each year worldwide. It forms when both retinoblastoma gene (RB1) alleles are mutated in a susceptible retinal cell, probably a cone photoreceptor precursor. Loss of the tumour-suppressive functions of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) leads to uncontrolled cell division and recurrent genomic changes during tumour progression. Although pRB is expressed in almost all tissues, cone precursors have biochemical and molecular features that may sensitize them to RB1 loss and enable tumorigenesis. Patient survival is {\textgreater}95\% in high-income countries but {\textless}30\% globally. However, outcomes are improving owing to increased disease awareness for earlier diagnosis, application of new guidelines and sharing of expertise. Intra-arterial and intravitreal chemotherapy have emerged as promising methods to salvage eyes that with conventional treatment might have been lost. Ongoing international collaborations will replace the multiple different classifications of eye involvement with standardized definitions to consistently assess the eligibility, efficacy and safety of treatment options. Life-long follow‑up is warranted, as survivors of heritable retinoblastoma are at risk for developing second cancers. Defining the molecular consequences of RB1 loss in diverse tissues may open new avenues for treatment and prevention of retinoblastoma, as well as second cancers, in patients with germline RB1 mutations.},

	abstract = {Background: Retinoblastoma is caused by loss of the Rb protein in early retinal cells. Although numerous Rb functions have been identified, Rb effects that specifically relate to the suppression of retinoblastoma have not been defined.
Results: In this study, we examined the effects of restoring Rb to Y79 retinoblastoma cells, using novel retroviral and lentiviral vectors that co-express green fluorescent protein (GFP). The lentiviral vector permitted transduction with sufficient efficiency to perform biochemical analyses. Wild type Rb (RbWT) and to a lesser extent the low penetrance mutant Rb661W induced a G0/G1 arrest associated with induction of p27KIP1 and repression of cyclin E1 and cyclin E2. Microarray analyses revealed that in addition to down-regulating E2F-responsive genes, Rb repressed expression of Brn-2 (POU3F2), which is implicated as an important transcriptional regulator in retinal progenitor cells and other neuroendocrine cell types. The repression of Brn-2 was a specific Rb effect, as ectopic p27 induced a G0/G1 block, but enhanced, rather than repressed, Brn-2 expression.
Conclusion: In addition to Rb effects that occur in many cell types, Rb regulates a gene that selectively governs the behavior of late retinal progenitors and related cells.},
