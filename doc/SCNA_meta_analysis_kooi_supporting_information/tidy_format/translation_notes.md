loaded in Kooi supplementary datasets. Omitted tables S1 and S2 because they contain general background information. loaded in {format (Kooi published title - saved file - description)}:
1)S3 - SCNA_peak_genes_kooi.csv -- genes annotated in maximum SCNA gain-loss within boundaries of 1% deflection from the peak. These genes displayed a gene-dosage effect and were considered candidate genes driving retinoblastoma oncogenesis.
2)S4 - DNA_RNA_expression_kooi.csv -- Log2-ratio (DNA) and Log2-transformed normalized expression (RNA) for genes profiled by SNP-array and gene-expression profiling.
3)S5 - per_gene_SCNA_gain_loss_val_kooi.csv -- Per-gene SCNA-gain-loss values
4)S6 - gistic_subset_analysis_kooi.csv -- GISTIC subset analysis results
5)S7 - RB1_b_allele_freq_kooi.csv -- B-allele frequencies of RB1
